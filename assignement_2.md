## Part 1 (4 points)
As for LM project, you have to apply these two modifications incrementally. Also in this case you may have to play with the hyperparameters and optimizers to improve the performance. 

Modify the baseline architecture Model IAS by:
- Adding bidirectionality
- Adding dropout layer

**Intent classification**: accuracy <br>
**Slot filling**: F1 score with conll

***Dataset to use: ATIS***

## Part 2 (11 points)

Adapt the code to fine-tune a pre-trained BERT model using a multi-task learning setting on intent classification and slot filling. 
You can refer to this paper to have a better understanding of how to implement this: https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.10909. In this, one of the challenges of this is to handle the sub-tokenization issue.

*Note*: The fine-tuning process is to further train on a specific task/s a model that has been pre-trained on a different (potentially unrelated) task/s.


The models that you can experiment with are [*BERT-base* or *BERT-large*](https://huggingface.co/google-bert/bert-base-uncased).
